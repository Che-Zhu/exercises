# Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet

In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.

## Requirements


### Task 1
Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our [example project](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/html-css-cheat-sheet/example/index.html), we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!

Possible topics could be:

- HTML Tables 
- Other HTML tags 
- CSS selectors and specificity 
- Common CSS properties

If you choose to document HTML tags, open the hint to see how to include HTML tags as text in your code.

### Task 2
Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in your HTML.

In our example site, we used tables with columns for:

- The tag or attribute name 
- The actual formatted tag (eg. `<table>`)
- A description of what to use the tag for.

You can use these same columns or choose your own.

### Requirement 3
Your site should utilize a custom color scheme. You can use any of the [named CSS colors](http://www.colors.commutercreative.com/grid/).
